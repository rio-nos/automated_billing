# automated_bill

Author: Nosorio Liberato

Date: August, 7th, 2020

Timeframe: This project took roughly 40 hours to complete. The amount time spent on this project consisted mostly of learning
	how to use the Selenium library, planning what data types to use to store variables, and implementing an efficient algorithm.

About:

	This project was motivated with the idea that I did not have the motivation to manually pay each individual's fair share of the bill. I gave up most of my responsibility on overseeing the bills for 6 individuals in our house and gave most of the responsibility to my automated python script.
The idea was that I could have this python script login to each websites pertaining to a service, retrieve the bill's balance, calculate each individual's share of the bill,
then apply the amount to each card and pay the bill.

Libraries used: Selenium.

Driver used: Chrome.

A "secrets.py" file was imported to retrieve user log-in information to be able to log-in into the websites.
