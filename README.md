# automated_bill

About:

	This project was motivated with the idea that I did not want to have to manually pay each individual's fair share of the bill.
The idea was that I could have this python script log-in into each of the bill's websites, retrieve the balance, calculate each individual's share of the bill,
then apply this amount to each individual's stored credit card and pay the bills.
