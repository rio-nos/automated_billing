# automated_bill

About:

	This project was motivated (ironically) with the idea that I did not want to manually pay each individual's fair share of the bill. I gave up most of my responsibility on overseeing the bills to an automated python script.
The idea was that I could have this python script login to each websites pertaining to a service, retrieve the bill's balance, calculate each individual's share of the bill,
then apply the amount to each card and pay the bill.

Libraries used: Selenium.

Driver used: Chrome.

A "secrets.py" file was imported to retrieve user log-in information to be able to log-in into the websites.
